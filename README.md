# Cortana in Games

In Windows 10, [Cortana](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-what-is-cortana)
can recognize your voice to tell you the time, check the weather for you, look
up your next scheduled meeting or simply chat with you. As a developer, you may
add as many additional voice commands to Cortana as you like â€“ a great
opportunity to increase the retention and lifetime value of your game.

This repository contains an example implementation of a small game which
allows the player to ask Cortana for their current gold, last attack or
building construction progress.

A detailed tutorial in how to integrate Cortana in your game can be found at
my [development blog](http://www.npruehs.de/cortana-for-games/).

If you have any questions or issues, please post a comment or open an issue
any time.
